# Decision Notes

## Architecture Decisions

### Why k3d Instead of Other Local Kubernetes Options?

**Decision**: Use k3d for local Kubernetes development
**Rationale**: 
- **Lightweight**: k3d runs k3s, which is much smaller than full Kubernetes
- **Fast startup**: Cluster creation takes seconds, not minutes
- **Production-like**: k3s is a certified Kubernetes distribution used in production
- **Resource efficient**: Uses minimal RAM and CPU compared to alternatives

**Alternatives considered**:
- **minikube**: Slower startup, more resource intensive
- **kind**: Good alternative, but k3d is faster for single-node clusters
- **Docker Desktop K8s**: Often unstable, resource heavy

### Why PostgreSQL + Redis Instead of Just One Database?

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL for persistence + Redis for caching
**Rationale**:
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable ACID compliance for game data and leaderboards
- **Redis**: Fast in-memory access for session data and real-time features
- **Production pattern**: This is how real applications are architected
- **Learning value**: Teaches database selection and integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Just PostgreSQL**: Would work but miss caching benefits
- **Just Redis**: Would lose data persistence
- **MongoDB**: Good for document storage but overkill for this use case

### Why Ingress Instead of Just NodePort Services?

**Decision**: Use Ingress controller for external access
**Rationale**:
- **Production pattern**: Real applications use Ingress for routing
- **Domain-based routing**: Can handle multiple domains and paths
- **TLS termination**: Built-in support for HTTPS
- **Load balancing**: Automatic traffic distribution

**Alternatives considered**:
- **NodePort**: Simpler but less production-like
- **LoadBalancer**: Overkill for local development
- **Port-forwarding**: Good for debugging but not for user access

## Technology Choices

### Why Prometheus + Grafana Instead of Simpler Monitoring?

**Decision**: Use Prometheus + Grafana for observability
**Rationale**:
- **Industry standard**: Used by 80%+ of Kubernetes deployments
- **Comprehensive**: Collects metrics, logs, and traces
- **Scalable**: Can handle thousands of services
- **Learning value**: Teaches production monitoring patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Simple metrics**: Would work but miss production experience
- **Cloud monitoring**: Vendor lock-in, not portable
- **Custom dashboards**: More work, less learning

### Why ArgoCD Instead of Other GitOps Tools?

**Decision**: Use ArgoCD for GitOps automation
**Rationale**:
- **Kubernetes native**: Built specifically for Kubernetes
- **Pull-based**: More secure than push-based approaches
- **Rich UI**: Excellent visualization of application state
- **Community support**: Large, active community

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Flux**: Good alternative, but ArgoCD has better UI
- **Jenkins**: More complex, not Kubernetes-native
- **Manual deployments**: No automation, error-prone

### Why Network Policies and Security Contexts?

**Decision**: Implement security hardening from the start
**Rationale**:
- **Production requirement**: Real applications need security
- **Learning value**: Teaches security best practices
- **Compliance**: Meets enterprise security standards
- **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of security

**Alternatives considered**:
- **No security**: Would work but unsafe
- **Basic security**: Would miss important protections
- **Over-security**: Could make development difficult

## Configuration Decisions

### Why Use ConfigMaps and Secrets Instead of Environment Variables?

**Decision**: Store configuration in Kubernetes resources
**Rationale**:
- **Separation of concerns**: Config separate from application code
- **Environment management**: Easy to manage different environments
- **Security**: Secrets are encrypted and access-controlled
- **Kubernetes native**: Leverages platform capabilities

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Environment variables**: Would work but less flexible
- **Config files**: Would work but harder to manage
- **External config**: Would work but adds complexity

### Why PersistentVolumeClaims Instead of EmptyDir?

**Decision**: Use PVCs for database storage
**Rationale**:
- **Data persistence**: Data survives pod restarts
- **Production pattern**: Real applications need persistent storage
- **Learning value**: Teaches storage management
- **Scalability**: Can be backed by different storage types

**Alternatives considered**:
- **EmptyDir**: Would work but lose data on restarts
- **HostPath**: Would work but not portable
- **External storage**: Would work but adds complexity

### Why Resource Limits and Requests?

**Decision**: Configure resource constraints for all pods
**Rationale**:
- **Resource management**: Prevents resource starvation
- **Predictability**: Ensures consistent performance
- **Production requirement**: Real applications need resource limits
- **Learning value**: Teaches resource planning

**Alternatives considered**:
- **No limits**: Would work but could crash cluster
- **Just requests**: Would work but no protection against overuse
- **Over-provisioning**: Would work but waste resources

## Development Workflow Decisions

### Why Milestone-Based Learning Instead of All-at-Once?

**Decision**: Break learning into progressive milestones
**Rationale**:
- **Cognitive load**: Easier to learn concepts incrementally
- **Success validation**: Each milestone provides achievement
- **Troubleshooting**: Easier to debug smaller changes
- **Confidence building**: Success at each step builds momentum

**Alternatives considered**:
- **All-at-once**: Would work but overwhelming
- **Random order**: Would work but confusing
- **Theory first**: Would work but boring

### Why Hands-On Instead of Just Reading?

**Decision**: Make everything hands-on and copy-pasteable
**Rationale**:
- **Learning retention**: Doing is better than just reading
- **Real experience**: Builds actual skills, not just knowledge
- **Confidence**: Success builds confidence to tackle real problems
- **Portfolio**: Creates something you can show and use

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Theory only**: Would work but not practical
- **Partial hands-on**: Would work but miss full experience
- **Video tutorials**: Would work but harder to follow

### Why Troubleshooting Sections in Every Milestone?

**Decision**: Include troubleshooting for every step
**Rationale**:
- **Real-world reality**: Problems happen, need to solve them
- **Learning opportunity**: Troubleshooting teaches debugging skills
- **Confidence building**: Knowing how to fix problems reduces fear
- **Self-sufficiency**: Enables independent problem-solving

**Alternatives considered**:
- **No troubleshooting**: Would work but frustrating when stuck
- **Separate troubleshooting**: Would work but harder to find
- **Community support only**: Would work but not immediate

## Production Readiness Decisions

### Why Start with Production Patterns Instead of Adding Later?

**Decision**: Use production patterns from the beginning
**Rationale**:
- **Habit formation**: Builds good practices from day one
- **No rework**: Don't need to refactor later
- **Real experience**: Learn what production actually looks like
- **Portfolio value**: What you build is actually useful

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Simple first**: Would work but need rework later
- **Production last**: Would work but miss learning opportunity
- **Optional production**: Would work but less valuable

### Why Include Security from the Start?

**Decision**: Implement security features in early milestones
**Rationale**:
- **Security mindset**: Builds security-first thinking
- **No vulnerabilities**: What you build is actually secure
- **Production ready**: Can deploy what you build
- **Learning value**: Security is a critical skill

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Security later**: Would work but insecure until then
- **Optional security**: Would work but miss important learning
- **No security**: Would work but unsafe

## These Decisions Matter Because...

1. **Real-world relevance**: Every decision mirrors what you'll see in production
2. **Skill development**: Each choice teaches important concepts
3. **Portfolio building**: What you create is actually valuable
4. **Confidence building**: Success with real tools builds real confidence
5. **Career preparation**: These patterns are what employers look for
