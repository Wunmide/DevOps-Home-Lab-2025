# üîí Security Contexts Explained - Complete Guide

## What Are Security Contexts?

**Security Contexts** are Kubernetes configurations that control **how containers run inside pods**. They're like "user permissions" for your containers.

## üîç The Two Levels of Security Contexts

### 1. Pod-Level Security Context
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true        # Pod can't run as root
        runAsUser: 1001          # Pod runs as user ID 1001
        fsGroup: 1001            # Volume ownership
        seccompProfile:          # Secure computing profile
          type: RuntimeDefault
        capabilities:             # Remove system privileges
          drop:
            - ALL
```

### 2. Container-Level Security Context
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: backend
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true                    # Container can't be root
        runAsUser: 1001                      # Container runs as user 1001
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false      # Can't gain root privileges
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: false        # Can write to logs directory
        capabilities:                         # Remove all Linux capabilities
          drop:
            - ALL
```

## üö® Why Are Security Contexts Critical?

### The Root Problem (Pun Intended):
- **By default**, Docker containers run as **root user (UID 0)**
- **Root containers** have **full system access** inside the container
- **If compromised**, root containers can:
  - Access the host filesystem
  - Install malicious software
  - Modify system files
  - Potentially escape container isolation

### Real Attack Scenario:
```
1. Attacker finds vulnerability in your app
2. Exploits it to get shell access inside container
3. Container is running as root ‚Üí Attacker has full access
4. Attacker can:
   - Read sensitive files
   - Install backdoors
   - Access other containers
   - Potentially escape to host
```

## ‚úÖ How Security Contexts Fix This

### Before (Dangerous):
```bash
# Container runs as root
$ whoami
root

# Attacker has full access
$ cat /etc/shadow
$ apt-get install malicious-tool
$ mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
```

### After (Secure):
```bash
# Container runs as limited user
$ whoami
backend

# Attacker has limited access
$ cat /etc/shadow
Permission denied

$ apt-get install malicious-tool
Permission denied

$ mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
Permission denied
```

## üè¢ Enterprise Security Benefits

1. **Compliance Ready**: Meets CIS, NIST, SOC2 security standards
2. **Production Grade**: Same security used by Google, Amazon, Microsoft
3. **Attack Surface Reduction**: Minimizes what attackers can do
4. **Defense in Depth**: Works with network policies for layered security

## üîß How to Verify Security Contexts Are Working

```bash
# Check if containers are running as non-root
kubectl exec -it deployment/frontend -n humor-game -- whoami
# Should return: nginx (not root)

kubectl exec -it deployment/backend -n humor-game -- whoami  
# Should return: backend (not root)

# Check security context configuration
kubectl describe deployment frontend -n humor-game | grep -A 10 "Security Context"
```

## üéØ Security Contexts vs Network Policies

| Aspect | Network Policies | Security Contexts |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **What they protect** | Communication between pods | Container execution inside pods |
| **Security level** | Network layer | Application layer |
| **Analogy** | Firewall between services | User permissions inside containers |
| **Attack prevention** | Lateral movement | Privilege escalation |

## üöÄ The Complete Security Picture

**Your application now has enterprise-grade security:**

1. **üîí Network Policies**: Control who can talk to whom
2. **üîí Security Contexts**: Control what containers can do
3. **üîí Resource Limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion
4. **üîí Health Checks**: Ensure services are healthy
5. **üîí Monitoring**: Detect and respond to issues

**This is exactly how production Kubernetes clusters are secured in real companies!** üéâ

The combination of network policies and security contexts provides **defense in depth** - even if one security layer is bypassed, the other layers continue to protect your application.

## üîç Common Security Context Options

### Basic Security Settings
```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true              # Must run as non-root user
  runAsUser: 1001                 # Specific user ID
  runAsGroup: 1001                # Specific group ID
  fsGroup: 1001                   # Volume ownership
```

### Advanced Security Settings
```yaml
securityContext:
  seccompProfile:                  # Secure computing profile
    type: RuntimeDefault
  capabilities:                     # Linux capabilities
    drop:
      - ALL                        # Remove all capabilities
    add:                           # Add specific capabilities (rare)
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false  # Prevent privilege escalation
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true     # Read-only filesystem
```

### Volume Security
```yaml
volumes:
  - name: logs
    emptyDir: {}
    securityContext:
      fsGroup: 1001               # Set group ownership
      runAsUser: 1001             # Set user ownership
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

1. **User IDs must exist**: The user ID you specify must exist in the container image
2. **Volume permissions**: Ensure volumes have correct ownership for your user
3. **Application compatibility**: Some applications expect to run as root
4. **Testing**: Always test security contexts in development first

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Start with `runAsNonRoot: true`** - This is the most important setting
2. **Use specific user IDs** - Don't rely on default users
3. **Drop unnecessary capabilities** - Start with `drop: ["ALL"]`
4. **Test thoroughly** - Security contexts can break applications
5. **Document changes** - Keep track of what security settings you've applied
